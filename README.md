# Material theme translator

A simple script to translate CSS styles from the format generated by m3.material.io to the format used in @difhel projects (such as the SDFUI library - https://github.com/nacteam/sdfui).

# Run
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/difhel/material-theme-translator
$ cd material-theme-translator
$ python3 main.py
> [1] Did you generate and download the theme archive? [y/n]: y
> [2] Enter the path to your ZIP archive or unzipped folder: /home/mf/Downloads/material-theme.zip
Writing colors...
Done. Colors has been written to /home/mf/material-theme-translator/output.css
```

# Warning
**This script does not support the latest MD3 colors and styles such as "primary-fixed", "surface-container-*" and some others, as Google's official theme builder has NOT been updated to support the new colors**. Once it is updated, this script will most likely continue to work as before. If something breaks or you need help - please create an issue.
